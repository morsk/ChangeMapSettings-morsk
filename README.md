# EditMapSettings

Allows you to change your map and map generation settings at any time you want. Note that map generation changes only apply to new chunks.

This is a fork of Bilka's [Change Map Settings](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ChangeMapSettings) for 2.0. I am likely to rewrite this with a different UI more suited to Space Age's planets, but I already spent 30 hours updating it, and there are people who want it, and I don't want to make them wait. Here it is!
